## Facial_Emotion_Detection_2 - Deep Learning - Convolutional Neural Networks
## Transfer Learning - VGG16, ResNet v2, and Efficient Net.

The facial expression recognition system built in this project is a technology capable of
recognising the expression on a human face from a digital image or a database of faces,
and this can form the basis on which other actions can be performed

The model should be able to perform multi-class classification on images of facial expressions, to
classify the expressions according to the associated emotion 'happy', 'sad', 'neutral',
'surprise'. 

**Objective:  Using transfer learning to find the most efficient Deep Learning architecture that can
accurately classify images of facial expressions into 4 classes namely 'happy', 'sad', 'neutral',
'surprise'.**
